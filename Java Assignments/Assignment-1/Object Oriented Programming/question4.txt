Question.4> Explain the concept of encapsulation with a suitable example.

Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some components, protecting the integrity of the objectâ€™s state by only allowing manipulation through defined methods. This is achieved by using private fields and providing public getter and setter methods. 

For example, in a banking system, the balance variable in an account class would be private, and deposit/withdraw methods would control changes to the balance, ensuring proper validation.
